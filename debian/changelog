  * debian/control: Reinstate big-endian builds, which can be salvaged
    adequately well.
  * debian/patches/big_endian_workaround (new): On big-endian
    architectures, roll makeblastdb's and makeprofiledb's default
    blastdb_version back to 4 pending a proper fix.  Some things,
    including in particular q2-feature-classifier, will still explicitly
    request version 5, but everything else should be OK.  (See #1077777.)
  * debian/rules: Try disabling optimization altogether on sh4.

ncbi-blast+ (2.16.0+ds-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/control: Forbid builds for big-endian architectures, at least
    for now.  They nominally succeed, but two dependent autopkgtests (for
    cct and kleborate) have started failing on s390x, and there's no
    evidence that other BE architectures fare any better.  (See #1077777.)
  * debian/rules:
    - Try building with -fsection-anchors on alpha in hopes of satisfying
      the GOT size limit there too.
    - Extend -O1 cap to sh4, which still encountered VM exhaustion.

    - Compile with -ffunction-sections on hppa and -mxgot on mips*
      (mips64el in practice) due to having outgrown default settings.
    - Disable parallel building on sh4 in hopes of avoiding buildd virtual
      memory exhaustion.

ncbi-blast+ (2.16.0+ds-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, which should be (more than) new enough for
    recent q2-feature-classifier.  (Closes: #1074316.)
  * debian/control:
    - Build against libnghttp2-dev, libsqlite3-dev, and libuv1-dev, newly
      needed.
    - Build against autoconf2.69.
    - Build against libpcre2-dev, as enabled by debian/patches/allow_pcre2.
    - Stop building against 2to3, which may not be around much longer.
  * debian/patches: Update for new release, mostly formally.
  * debian/patches/2to3 (new): Cache 2to3 diff for
    windowmasker_2.2.22_adapter.
  * debian/patches/allow_pcre2 (new): Allow use of PCRE2.
  * debian/patches/series:
    - Move system_mbedtls_only up in conjunction with incorporating part
      of an upstream patch needed by support_mbedtls3.
    - Comment out reprobuild; I'm all for reproducibility, but the package
      already automatically builds with flags that make __FILE__ relative,
      and many of its uses are in header-defined macros that intend to
      pick up their callers' paths.
  * debian/patches/support_mbedtls3 (new): Support (but don't require)
    Mbed TLS 3.x.  (Closes: #1075867.)
  * debian/patches/system_mbedtls: Extend to cover ncbi_mbedtls.c (as in
    https://github.com/ncbi/ncbi-cxx-toolkit-public/commit/f9c7297dd1)
    and Makefile.xxconnect2.lib.
  * debian/rules:
    - Regenerate configure and config.h.in with Autoconf 2.69.
    - Build against PCRE2, as enabled by debian/patches/allow_pcre2.
      (Closes: #891197.)
    - Tune flags: Add --without-strip to make --with-symbols effective;
      switch off warnings from __DATE__/__TIME__ usage, since
      dpkg-buildpackage's SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH injection should suffice.
    - Extend generated-sources cleanup to objtools/eutils (not entirely
      straightforward due to input format variation).
    - Drop build-time 2to3 invocation in favor of debian/patches/2to3.
  * debian/source/lintian-overrides: No more rapidjson10 (just ...11).
  * Standards-Version: 4.7.0 (routine-update)

  * Standards-Version: 4.6.0 (routine-update)
  * watch file standard 4 (routine-update)
  * debian/patches/suppress_tls_version_checks (formerly
    suppress_gnutls_version_check): Suppress the mbed TLS version check too.

    Debian builds make no use of this (Java) GUI or supporting third-party
    jars, and could do without prebuilt binaries even if they did use it.
  * debian/copyright:

      duplicate .../ncbi_menu_dnd.js by .../ncbi_menu_dyn.js.

      overflow.

      opening a pair of databases is a distinct possibility.

    - Allow for cross-building (Closes: #930240):
    -- Factor a DEB_CONFIGURE_COMMON_FLAGS macro out of
       DEB_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_FLAGS for flags that also make sense for native
       builds of internal helpers.
    -- Conditionally supply --build=... and --host= to the main
       (historically, only) configure run per Helmut Grohne's suggestion.
       (dh_auto_configure would take care of this, but insists on passing
       a --runstatedir=... flag this configure script doesn't accept.)
    -- Conditionally add a rule for building native datatool and
       project_tree_builder binaries (in a parallel build tree established
       via another configure invocation), make it a dependency of
       override_dh_auto_configure-arch, and arrange for everything else to
       use these binaries as needed.
    -- Honor DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="... nocheck ...", also per Helmut.
    -- Rework logic to install (possibly indirect) local library
       dependencies to use readelf rather than ldd, making as many passes
       as necessary (four at present, but no hardcoded count).
    - Install get_species_taxids without the .sh suffix.

ncbi-blast+ (2.2.26-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Aaron M. Ucko ]
  * debian/patches/fix_gcc47_errors: fix various GCC 4.7 compilation
    errors and warnings.  (Closes: #669679.)
    - Explicitly qualify more dependent names originating in base templates.
    - Directly #include headers as needed.
    - Use modern syntax for making protected base members public.
    - Add forward declarations as needed.
  * Wrap and sort build dependencies to ease maintenance thereof.
  * Enable full hardening flags, introducing a small patch
    (use_pie_for_apps) to reflect the need to build executables and
    libraries differently.
  * Use upstream's new --with-symbols flag in nostrip builds.

  [ Andreas Tille ]
  * debian/control: Modernize Vcs-* fields.

    the python dependency of /usr/bin/windowmasker_2.2.22_adapter

   * debian/control:
     + Luca Capello <luca@pca.it>, fix reference for legacy_blast
       (Closes: #642986).
     + add a new line to separate the actual description from usage
      instruction in the long Description:.
   * debian/rules: add gene_info_reader binary in package

ncbi-blast+ (2.2.25-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Team upload.
  * debian/patches/hurd_fixes: further patch configure(.ac) to reflect
    -Wl,rpath,... support.  (Closes: #629656.)
  * debian/patches/fix_lib_deps: link makembindex and srsearch against
    libxconnect rather than libconnect for consistency with libblast,
    which uses the former for consistency with other projects.

 -- Aaron M. Ucko <ucko@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Aug 2011 12:31:05 -0400

ncbi-blast+ (2.2.25-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Aaron M. Ucko ]
  * Team upload.
  * debian/patches/support_other_cpus: belatedly add a descriptive header.
  * debian/patches/hurd_fixes: new; fix hurd-specific issues.
    (In conjunction with the following change, finally closes: #629656.)
  * debian/control:
    - Build-Depends += libc0.3-dev (>= 2.13-9~) [hurd-i386] to avoid #630180.
    - Declare both binary packages as Multi-Arch: foreign.
  * debian/patches/fix_lib_deps: new; ensure that all libraries link against
    all direct dependencies.  (Break the dependency loop between libxblast
    and libxalgoblastdbindex by having the former provide only the C++ BLAST
    API, leaving the C core only in libblast.)  (Closes: #633567.)
  * debian/rules: tweak LDFLAGS, supplying -Wl,--as-needed across the
    board (as it is now safe to do so) and adding -Wl,--enable-new-dtags
    to allow LD_LIBRARY_PATH to override the private rpath.
  * debian/patches/no_multiarch_rpath: new; avoid redundant rpath entries
    on multiarch systems (courtesy of overzealous logic to ensure
    executables will be able to find libstdc++.)

  [ Andreas Tille ]
  * Enhances: t-coffee (as stated in tasks file)

ncbi-blast+ (2.2.25-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Team upload.
  * debian/rules:
    - Export MAKE to override an internal upstream build script that
      otherwise incorrectly defaults to gmake on non-Linux
      architectures. (Really closes: #629656, with any luck.)
    - Force CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash to avoid lossage that can occur with zsh4
      masquerading as ksh, which configure otherwise favors (due to complaints
      from users with broken BASH_ENV scripts that change directories).

ncbi-blast+ (2.2.25-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Team upload.
  * Fix several sources of build failures (closes: #629656):
    - debian/rules (override_dh_install): Correctly support building only
      architecture-dependent packages.
      (DEB_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_FLAGS): Add --without-caution to override the
      upstream build system's reluctance to build shared libraries on the
      Hurd or kFreeBSD, which it doesn't specifically recognize.  Limit C++
      optimization level to -O (rather than the default -O2) on mips(el),
      on which g++ otherwise crashes. :-/
    - debian/patches/support_other_cpus (new; committed upstream too):
      build correctly on architectures that wound up defining
      NCBI_SLOW_ATOMIC_SWAP (spuriously in the case of powerpc,
      whose detection the patch fixes as well).
